          <h3>Meet more people.</h3>
          <p>Cnvrge makes it incredibly easy to meet lots of new people per hour. Participants are energized and actively pitching their work at Cnvrge events. They’ll leave the event feeling great after meeting tons of new people and they’ll want to come back to the next one.</p>

          <h3>Ditch the business cards.</h3>
          <p>All participants who provide their email will get an email digest listing all the people they met, including name, bio, email, and the location and the meeting number in which they met. This provides a safety net for those who might have forgotten their business cards.</p>

          <h3>Organizers add huge value.</h3>
          <p>You’ve managed to get a lot of people to come to your event. Most people have come to meet new people, pitch their ideas, gain business contacts, but the majority of them will leave having met only a few new people. Cnvrge turns a typical social event into a high energy meeting-fest. People leave happy, and that means they’ll come back for more.</p>
